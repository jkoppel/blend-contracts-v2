When contributing assets, LPs receive pool shares in the form of LP tokens proportional to their contribution. These tokens represent their ownership stake in the pool and their claim on both the deposited assets and any accumulated fees or rewards.\n\nLPs interact with the protocol primarily through the `join_pool()` function, which takes their token contributions and mints corresponding LP tokens:\n\n```rust\nclient.join_pool(\n    &amount,\n    &vec![&env, blnd_mint_amount, usdc_mint_amount],\n    &user\n);\n```\n\nLiquidity Providers are essential to the Blend ecosystem because they:\n\n1. Supply the capital necessary for the protocol's lending operations\n2. Maintain pool liquidity for seamless trading and borrowing\n3. Earn rewards through trading fees and emissions programs\n4. Support the backstop mechanism that helps absorb bad debt\n\nThe LP tokens can be redeemed at any time to reclaim the provider's share of the pool, including their portion of accumulated fees. However, LPs should be aware of risks including impermanent loss if the relative prices of pooled assets change significantly during the time they provide liquidity."

The protocol handles volatility through configurable parameters like `reactivity`, which determines how quickly interest rates adjust in response to changing market conditions. Lower reactivity values provide more stability during volatile periods by dampening rate adjustments, while higher values make the system more responsive to market changes. This is particularly visible in interest rate calculations (`calc_accrual` function), where the protocol adjusts rates based on the difference between current and target utilization levels, moderated by the reactivity parameter."

In this codebase, arbitrage manifests primarily through auction mechanisms that create opportunities for traders to profit when assets are temporarily mispriced.\n\nThe protocol implements several auction types (liquidation auctions and interest auctions) where participants can purchase assets at potentially discounted rates. For example, in an interest auction, backstop providers bid with LP tokens to acquire underlying assets that have accumulated as interest. These mechanisms ensure market efficiency by inviting external actors to rebalance the system when imbalances occur.\n\nThe code shows how arbitrage opportunities are systematically created and resolved through functions like `create_interest_auction_data` and `fill_interest_auction`, which leverage oracle price feeds to ensure fair market values. This process maintains liquidity, promotes price discovery, and ultimately contributes to the stability and efficiency of the lending pools in the Blend ecosystem."

When a user fills an auction or performs a liquidation, they can specify a percentage (0-100) indicating how much of the original transaction they wish to execute. The protocol then scales both the bid amount and the receiving assets proportionally.\n\nThis percentage-based scaling is critical for risk management and capital efficiency, allowing users to:\n\n1. Partially fill auctions without requiring the full amount\n2. Execute liquidations in manageable portions\n3. Adjust their exposure based on market conditions\n\nThe protocol enforces validation to ensure percentage values are within valid ranges and prevents excessive position concentration. Unlike traditional DEX slippage (which is about price movement during transaction confirmation), Blend's slippage is a deliberate feature that enables transaction scaling with predictable outcomes."

Each auction includes data about block timing, bid assets, lot assets, and the relationships between them. The protocol handles order matching through functions that calculate fair values, apply interest rates, and manage settlement while ensuring maximum capital efficiency.\n\nThis approach combines elements of traditional Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs) with the programmability of on-chain systems, enabling features like dynamic pricing based on time elapsed, partial filling of orders, and backstop protection mechanismsâ€”all while maintaining the transparency and security benefits of decentralized protocols."

The protocol carefully scales these values through functions like `scale_auction` to maintain appropriate depth during liquidations and price discovery.\n\nStrong market depth enables:\n- Execution of large trades with minimal price impact\n- Efficient liquidation auctions during volatile conditions\n- Stable borrowing and lending rates across varying transaction sizes\n\nThe depth distribution is particularly evident in Blend's auction mechanics where bids are scaled based on time elapsed (`sequence_number`) and fill percentage, ensuring liquidations can be properly absorbed by the market without excessive price disruption."

The protocol handles all settlement logic, ensuring trades happen exactly at the specified rates.

Unlike traditional stop-loss orders that users manually configure, Blend implements this concept through its liquidation auction system that automatically triggers when a borrower's position becomes undercollateralized.\n\nWhen a user's health factor (the ratio of collateral value to borrowed assets) falls below predetermined thresholds, the protocol initiates a liquidation auction that sells a portion of the user's collateral to repay outstanding debt. This process happens automatically on-chain without requiring user intervention, effectively functioning as a protocol-level stop-loss that limits potential losses.\n\nThe process involves several components:\n- Automated detection of unsafe positions through oracle price feeds\n- Creation of liquidation auctions with `new_auction()` \n- Bidding mechanisms that allow liquidators to repay debt in exchange for discounted collateral\n- Backstop systems that handle edge cases where liquidations don't fully cover losses\n\nThis approach differs from traditional stop-loss orders as it's not user-configurable but instead operates according to protocol-defined safety parameters, ensuring that the lending system remains solvent even during significant market volatility."

While not directly using the term \"maker fee,\" the protocol employs a fee structure where liquidity providers receive compensation through mechanisms like the `bstop_rate` parameter in the PoolConfig structure.\n\nUnlike traditional exchanges with simple maker-taker fee models, Blend uses a more sophisticated approach where fees are integrated into the protocol's interest rate mechanisms, backstop system, and auction design, creating incentives for capital efficiency and risk management in its permissionless lending pools."

The codebase shows stablecoins being approved for transfers (`stable.approve`), tracked for balances (`stable.balance`), supplied to pools, and used in liquidation calculations. \n\nStablecoins are particularly valuable in DeFi lending because they:\n- Reduce price volatility risk for borrowers and lenders\n- Provide a consistent unit of account for interest calculations\n- Serve as reliable collateral or borrowed assets\n- Enable predictable financial planning within the ecosystem\n\nThe protocol's architecture treats stablecoins as standard tokens with approval mechanisms and balance tracking, allowing them to flow through the system's lending, borrowing, and liquidation processes."

Unlike traditional liquidity mining implementations, Blend's system automatically converts claimed rewards into LP tokens and reinvests them back into the backstop pools, creating a compounding effect.\n\nThe system uses an index-based tracking mechanism to calculate rewards across multiple pools based on each user's proportional share and time elapsed since the last update. When users claim rewards, the protocol:\n\n1. Calculates total accrued emissions across all specified pools\n2. Converts these BLND tokens to LP tokens via the Comet LP pool\n3. Proportionally distributes the resulting LP tokens back to the user's positions\n\nThis auto-reinvestment mechanism not only rewards liquidity providers but also strengthens the protocol's backstop reserves, enhancing overall stability and creating a virtuous cycle where participation in liquidity mining directly improves protocol security."

When the market price remains within a targeted range or when specific assets require liquidity support, the concentrated capital is activated and generates greater efficiency, similar to Uniswap V3's tick-based liquidity deployment but adapted for lending rather than trading.\n\nBy implementing concentrated liquidity principles in a lending context, Blend achieves higher capital efficiency, better risk management, and can offer improved terms for both borrowers and lenders in the protocol."
